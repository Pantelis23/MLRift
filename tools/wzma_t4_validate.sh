# Task 4 (tiled dU/dx) validation — RUN ONLY AFTER A GPU COLD POWER CYCLE.
#   The first buggy run (kernarg 504-byte segment OOB) wedged MES; the fix
#   (kernarg segment 504->512) is in the tree but UNVALIDATED on GPU.
#
# Sequence:
#   1) NW=1: rebuild mlrc+kernel+launcher, run -> dumps the T4 NW=1 oracle
#      (dU sum-order changed in T4, so the oracle MUST be regenerated).
#   2) NW=8: rebuild, run x3 -> validate loss<=1e-2 + grads<=1e-3 vs oracle,
#      capture segment-B ms/step, confirm no wedge across 3 runs.
#
# If ANY run prints [KFD-WEDGE]: STOP. Do NOT reboot/rmmod. Cold-cycle only.
