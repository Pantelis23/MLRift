# MLRift -- living-compiler verified-migrations, Task 7
#
# The acceptance criterion: run the type-alias migration at FULL SCALE --
# every long-form uint8/16/32/64 and int8/16/32/64 keyword in the whole
# compiler, ~24.7k sites -- and prove the compiler emits byte-identical
# code afterwards.
#
# Two rules this script exists to honour:
#
#   1. PROVE IT ON A COPY. A migrated src/ must never be committed. The
#      migration runs on $WORK/unit.mlr, a mktemp -d copy of build/mlrc.mlr;
#      Step 3 asserts the tracked tree came through untouched.
#
#   2. OBJECT IDENTITY IS NOT THE WHOLE PROOF. Comparing .o files covers
#      emitted code and string data, but a comment is invisible to it -- and
#      comment corruption is the ORIGINAL DEFECT this project exists to close
#      (the old byte-scanner rewrote the literal "uint64" inside
#      match_keyword(start, len, "uint64", 6), and the length argument 6
#      stayed behind). Step 4 therefore asserts the comments directly.
#
# Step 4 is POSITION-AWARE, not line-based, and that distinction is the whole
# point. Of the 32,484 comment-bearing lines in build/mlrc.mlr only 25,029 are
# whole-line comments; the other ~7,455 carry code AND a trailing comment on
# the same line -- and those are the dangerous ones, because the line holds a
# token that MUST migrate right next to comment text that must NOT:
#
#     static uint64 ir_live_words = 0   // uint64 words per bitset = ...
#
# A whole-line-comment diff cannot see the right-hand `uint64` corrupted; nor
# can a comment-line count; nor can object identity, since comments never
# reach emitted code. So every check below splits each line at the first `//`
# that is OUTSIDE a string literal (four lines in this source contain `//`
# only inside a hip_emit_cstr string -- a naive split misclassifies them) and
# asserts what each half must satisfy: the comment half byte-identical, the
# code half holding zero long-form spellings afterwards.

#                has a real comment -- W when the comment is the whole line,
#                T when it trails code. The W/T flag rides in the compared
#                text on purpose: a comment that stayed byte-identical but
#                moved from trailing to whole-line means the code beside it
#                vanished, and that must not pass either.
# mode=code    : print "<lineno>:<code text>" with the comment AND string /
#                char literal CONTENTS removed, so a grep over it sees only
#                real code tokens.
# mode=check   : print how many lines end inside an unterminated literal.
#                MLRift string and char literals do not span lines in this
