# MLRift

A systems language for machine-learning workloads — built on
[KernRift](https://github.com/Pantelis23/KernRift) at commit `6cf758b`
(v2.8.15). The compiler's own source is KernRift; MLRift extends the
KRIR backend with ML-specific primitives (tensors, event streams,
continuous-time dynamics, sparse CSR ops, plasticity rules) and will
introduce a `.mlr` frontend for user programs as the roadmap lands.

**Status:** day zero. The rename pass is done (product identity is
MLRift, binary is `mlrc`, bootstrap binary is `build/mlrc`), 436/436
tests pass, self-host fixed point holds. The MLRift-specific syntax
and IR extensions are not started yet — those follow the roadmap in
`~/Desktop/Projects/Work/ideas/MLRift.md`.

## What works today

Real LLM inference is already running end-to-end through the existing
KernRift compiler + a small ML stdlib (`std/qwen3.mlr`,
`std/matmul.mlr`, `std/tokenizer.mlr`, `std/gguf.mlr`) — no external
runtime, no Python.

| Model | Quant | tok/s | vs PyTorch BF16 | Peak RSS |
|---|---|---:|---:|---:|
| Qwen3-0.6B | bf16 (HF safetensors) | 32.03 | **1.24×** | 1.67 GB |
| Qwen3-0.6B | bf16 (GGUF) | 32.27 | **1.25×** | 1.67 GB |
| **Qwen3-14B** | **Q8_0 (GGUF)** | **0.479** | **3.63×** | **14.81 GB** |

7900X / 16 threads / greedy decode / use_cache. First 10 generated
tokens are bit-identical to HuggingFace `transformers.generate`
across both sizes (token-id check, not a fuzzy text match). Methodology
+ commit-by-commit perf history:

- `docs/BENCH_QWEN3.md` — Qwen3-0.6B (78× from scalar baseline, 3.27×
  vs PyTorch F32, full per-op breakdown).
- `docs/BENCH_QWEN3_14B.md` — Qwen3-14B Q8_0 vs PyTorch BF16 (3.63×
  decode, 1.37× less peak RSS, 5-token prompt → 20-token greedy
  continuation).

## Build

```
make build    # self-compiles build/mlrc (bootstrap committed)
make test     # 436/436
make bootstrap   # verify stage3 == stage4
mlrc --version
```

## Why "built on KernRift"

MLRift is explicitly a **layer on top of KernRift**, not a hard fork.
It shares the type system, the optimization pipeline, the codegen
backends (x86_64 + ARM64, Linux/macOS/Windows/Android), and all the
infrastructure KernRift spent the last year hardening. MLRift-specific
work lives in added passes, added IR ops, and a new frontend — not in
re-implementing the basics. When KernRift fixes a backend bug,
MLRift inherits it with a cherry-pick.
